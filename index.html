    <p>Machine learning (ML) is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
        that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. 
        It involves feeding data into algorithms that can then identify patterns 
        and make predictions on new data. Machine learning is used in a wide variety of
         applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, 
         and recommender systems.</p>
