    <p>The Yoga Club was established in 2021â€“22. Yoga Club conducts programmes for students
        as well as staff members of GLAU to understand the importance of maintaining good health
        
        both physically and mentally under the supervision of Yoga Trainer (Mrs. Sonika). The Yoga Club
        raises awareness about the value of yoga and other yoga activities among students, staff members,
        and GLAU-adopted schools in the Mathura region, encouraging them to share their bodies and minds on
        conscious and subconscious levels. All members of the yoga club actively work on yoga principles and
        strive to find a ray of enlightenment that will offer them true happiness and inner peace.</p>
